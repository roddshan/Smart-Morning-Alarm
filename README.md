# Smart-Morning-Alarm
This is an IoT project which is an alarm system which you cannot snooze or turn off. It senses that if you are present on the bed, it beeps.
            My project is a Smart Morning Alarm system which uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance. Just place the device in the side of the bed take one reading and put that limit in the program. Set the time when you want to wake up for e.g., you want to wake up at 4 a.m. so, min_time=4 and max_time=5. Once all the parameters have been set up the run the code.

I made this project because I am very lazy and because of this habit I get late everyday. Once the alarm beeps I snooze or turn off the alarm and sleep. So, to change this behaviour of mine I made this alarm system which I cannot snooze or turn off.
